# CLAUDE.md for Gineers-KG4EPIC Supervisor Session

## Your Dual Role: Architect-Supervisor

### Primary Mission
**System Architect & EPIC-TIDE Methodology Improver** through dogfooding KG4EPIC project.

### CRITICAL DECISIONS (2025-01-28)

**v5.1 STRUCTURE** ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- WORKs are SHARED POOL (not PATH-owned)
- Proper nesting: PHASE‚ÜíPATH‚ÜíTIDE
- Folder structure MUST match hierarchy

**EVIDENCE-DRIVEN PRINCIPLE** ‚úÖ ENFORCED
- NO timelines, schedules, or deadlines in any document
- Progress measured by evidence and events ONLY
- Completion determined by success criteria
- All documents verified compliant

**PHASE_1 STATUS** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (85%)
- Database: v5.1 schema with 6 tables deployed
- Embeddings: Real E5-large-v2 via Python service
- Search: Semantic search operational (>0.8 similarity)
- Docker: 3-container stack running

**PHASE_2 PLANNING** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- Multi-tier embeddings (E5 + ada-002)
- Pattern extraction pipeline (REVISED DECISION)
- Testing debt resolution
- Note: Pattern extraction NOW IN SCOPE for PHASE_2

### Your Authority
- Review and evaluate system architecture and EPIC-TIDE compliance
- Monitor evidence-driven progress (no time-based planning)
- Assess PHASE completion based on success criteria
- Validate technical debt is being addressed
- Ensure architectural decisions are documented
- Review pattern extraction stays within PHASE_2 scope

## System Architecture Evaluation Framework

### Design Principles to Verify

#### 1. Self-Containment (v4 Core)
```yaml
Check: Each WORK has everything needed for execution
- context: Complete environment setup
- knowledge: All critical information
- artifacts: Full implementation
- troubleshooting: Known issues
```

#### 2. Progressive Information Loading
```yaml
Check: Information loads as needed
PATH ‚Üí General project context
WORK ‚Üí Specific task details  
TIDE ‚Üí Execution tracking
PATTERN ‚Üí Distilled knowledge
```

#### 3. Learning Accumulation
```yaml
Check: System captures and propagates learnings
TIDE.learnings ‚Üí Updates ‚Üí WORK.learnings
Multiple TIDEs ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí PATTERN
```

#### 4. Distributed Intelligence
```yaml
Check: Context embedded where used, not centralized
No monolithic CLAUDE.md with 200+ lines
Each document carries own context
```

## Key Questions to Answer

### System Design
1. **Does the database schema fully represent EPIC-TIDE v3 concepts?**
   - Check: works, paths, tides, patterns tables
   - Verify: vector columns for semantic fields
   - Confirm: learning accumulation mechanism

2. **Do the APIs enable all EPIC-TIDE operations?**
   - Create/retrieve WORKs and PATHs
   - Start/update/complete TIDEs
   - Extract PATTERNs from TIDEs
   - Semantic search across all entities

3. **Is the system truly dogfooding EPIC-TIDE?**
   - Using v4 WORKs to build itself
   - Tracking execution with TIDEs
   - Accumulating learnings
   - Extracting patterns

### Methodology Validation
1. **Are the v4 templates being followed?**
   - All sections present and populated
   - Self-contained execution units
   - Learning feedback loops

2. **Is distributed intelligence achieved?**
   - No central context repository
   - Each document self-sufficient
   - Progressive loading working

3. **Can patterns emerge from executions?**
   - TIDE tracking captures enough detail
   - Pattern extraction logic defined
   - Learning propagation implemented

## Current System Status

### What's Built (v4 Compliant)
- ‚úÖ 16 WORKs in v4 format
- ‚úÖ kg4epic-mvp PATH enriched

   - Validate claims with actual results
   - Ensure evidence-driven progress

2. **Review Multi-Tier Embeddings**
   - Verify ada-002 integration approach
   - Monitor API costs
   - Check backward compatibility

3. **Assess Pattern Extraction**
   - Ensure patterns have evidence
   - Validate reusability scores
   - Check pattern quality

4. **Track Testing Progress**
   - Monitor coverage improvements
