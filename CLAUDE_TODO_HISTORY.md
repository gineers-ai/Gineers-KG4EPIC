## Key Achievements

### Paradigm Shift Accomplished
Transformed EPIC-TIDE from static documentation to **living, self-contained execution units** that:
- Carry their own context
- Learn from experience
- Guide AI agents autonomously
- Improve with each use

### Documents Created/Updated
- 3 new methodology documents
- 4 v4 template files
- 4 migrated v4 WORKs
- 3 CLAUDE role-specific guides
- 1 compliance report

### Version Progress
```
Before: v2 static blueprints
After: v4 self-contained, AI-native documents
Migration: 4/26 complete (15%)
```

## 2025-01-28 Session

- [x] Migrate remaining 22 WORKs to v4 format
- [x] Create V4_MIGRATION_REPORT.md
- [x] Achieve 100% v4 compliance (16/16 WORKs)

### ✅ Supervisor Role Creation
- [x] Create CLAUDE_GKG4EPIC_supervisor.md
- [x] Add Terminal 3 (Supervisor) to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Perform architecture review
- [x] Create ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md in Monitoring folder

### ✅ Architecture Decisions
- [x] Separate passive storage (KG4EPIC) from active intelligence (Gineers-ACC)
- [x] Define tiered embedding strategy (E5 → ada-002 → 3-large)
- [x] Update all CLAUDE docs to prevent scope creep
- [x] Move non-EPIC-TIDE docs to Monitoring folder

### ✅ EPIC-TIDE v5 Evolution (Major Breakthrough)

- [x] Define PHASE vs TIDE distinction (vertical vs horizontal)
- [x] Create EPIC_TIDE_METHODOLOGY_v5_PHASE_AWARE.md
- [x] Update FOUNDATION_DATASET.sql with PHASE table
- [x] Create PHASE_v5_ai_native.yml template
- [x] Update all templates to v5 with PHASE support
- [x] Create UPDATE_REPORT_v5.md for other documents

## Key Achievements (2025-01-28)

### Major Discovery: PHASE Concept
**Problem**: EPIC-TIDE lacked mechanism for scope expansion
**Solution**: PHASE hierarchy level above PATH
- **PHASE**: Vertical evolution (expanding scope/goals)
- **TIDE**: Horizontal iteration (multiple attempts at same goal)

### Hierarchy Evolution
```
v3: PROGRAM → PATH → TIDE → PATTERN
v5: PROGRAM → PHASE → PATH → TIDE → PATTERN
```

### Architectural Clarity
```
KG4EPIC = Passive Document Store (CRUD only)
Gineers-ACC = Active Intelligence (patterns, learning)
```

### Embedding Strategy
```
Phase 1: E5-large-v2 only (FREE)
Phase 2: + text-embedding-ada-002 ($)
Phase 3: + text-embedding-3-large ($$)
```

## 2025-01-28 Evening Session

### ✅ EPIC-TIDE v5.1 Critical Fix (Architect)
- [x] Identify folder structure violation of v5 hierarchy
- [x] Recognize WORKs must be shared pool, not PATH-owned
- [x] Create EPIC_TIDE_METHODOLOGY_v5_1_CORRECTED.md
- [x] Update FOUNDATION_DATASET.sql with junction table for PATH-WORK
- [x] Update all templates to v5.1
- [x] Archive old methodology versions (v3, v5.0)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with v5.1 changes
- [x] Update CLAUDE_methodology_creator.md with findings

### Key Discovery: Structural Flaw
**Problem**: Folder structure didn't match v5 hierarchy
- PHASEs and PATHs were siblings instead of nested
- WORKs placement was ambiguous
- No EXECUTIONs mirroring structure

**Solution**: v5.1 Corrected Structure
```
BLUEPRINTs/
  phases/
    PHASE_1_free.yml
    PHASE_1_free/
      paths/
        kg4epic-mvp.yml
  works/  # Shared pool (reusable)

EXECUTIONs/
  phases/
    PHASE_1_free/
      paths/
        kg4epic-mvp/
          TIDE_1/
```

### Critical Insight
**WORKs are reusable components** that can be referenced by multiple PATHs across different PHASEs - they should NOT be buried in PATH-specific folders.

## 2025-01-28 Late Night Session

### ✅ Evidence-Driven Principle Enforcement (Architect)
- [x] Identified and removed ALL time/timeline references from documents
- [x] Changed "timeline" to "evidence_target" in PHASE documents
- [x] Changed "duration" to "evidence" in TIDE templates
- [x] Removed time-based commitments (weeks/months/hours)
- [x] Added explicit evidence-driven principle to v5.1 methodology
- [x] Updated all CLAUDE*.md files with the principle
- [x] Enforced "No schedules, only evidence" rule

### The Fundamental Discovery
**EPIC-TIDE is EVIDENCE-DRIVEN, not time-driven**
- Progress is measured by evidence and events
- Completion is determined by success criteria
- No timelines, schedules, or deadlines
- Teams coordinate through evidence events, not calendars

This principle is now:
1. Documented in v5.1 methodology as Core Principle
2. Enforced in all templates (removed time references)
3. Recorded in all CLAUDE guide files
4. Part of critical decisions log

## 2025-08-30 Session - v8 PHASE_1 Implementation

### Key Achievements (2025-08-30)

### v8 Architecture Clarity
**Critical Understanding**: KG4EPIC implements MCP contract directly
```
Claude Code → MCP Server → KG4EPIC /api/tool → PostgreSQL
     ↓           ↓              ↓                ↓
Orchestrates   Bridge    MCP Contract      Database
```

### v8 Schema Simplification
```
v5.1: 6 tables (phases, paths, tides, works, path_works, patterns)
v8:   4 tables (blueprints, executions, evidence, patterns)
```

### Technical Learnings
- Vectors must use array string format `[n,n,n]` for PostgreSQL
- Database host must be 'postgres' in Docker network, not 'localhost'
- Tool registry pattern works well for MCP routing
- Single endpoint with internal routing simplifies architecture

### ✅ Additional v8 Implementation (Developer - Continued)
- [x] Implement embedding pipeline (verified already working)
- [x] Implement semantic search across entities (cross-entity search)
- [x] Optimize search performance (created IVFFlat indexes)
- [x] Standardize responses to MCP format (verified compliance)
- [x] Deploy complete system (Docker Compose operational)

### ✅ v8 PHASE_1 COMPLETION (Developer)
- [x] Created comprehensive integration tests (18 test cases)
- [x] All 18 MCP tools tested and passing
- [x] 100% test success rate achieved
- [x] v8 PHASE_1 marked as COMPLETE
