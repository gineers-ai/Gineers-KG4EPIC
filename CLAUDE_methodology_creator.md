# CLAUDE.md for EPIC-TIDE Methodology Creation Sessions

## What We Built: EPIC-TIDE v3 (AI-Native)

### The Journey (2025-01-27)
We evolved EPIC-TIDE from v2 (human-centric) to v3 (AI-native) with revolutionary changes.

## Key Innovation: Distributed Intelligence

### The Problem We Solved:
- Static CLAUDE.md files with 200+ lines
- Context scattered across multiple documents
- Learning lost after execution
- AI agents needed external lookups

### The Solution We Created:
**Self-contained, living documents that carry their own context and learn from experience, refer on demand**

## What We Created Today

### 1. Core Methodology Evolution
```
EPIC-TIDE v2 (old):
- Separate documentation
- Static blueprints
- Lost learnings

EPIC-TIDE v3 (new): # Docs/EPIC-TIDE-ADV/EPIC_TIDE_METHODOLOGY_v3_AI_NATIVE.md
- Embedded context in PATHs/WORKs
- Living documents that learn
- Progressive information loading
```

### 2. Document Structure Revolution

#### Enriched PATH (v4)
```yaml
PATH:
  # NEW SECTIONS WE ADDED:
  project:            # Full project context
  decisions:          # Architectural choices
  learnings:          # Accumulated wisdom
  for_new_session:    # Bootstrap instructions
  current_focus:      # What to work on now
```

#### Enriched WORK (v4)
```yaml
WORK:
  # NEW SECTIONS WE ADDED:
  context:           # Task environment
  knowledge:         # Critical information
  learnings:         # From executions
  troubleshooting:   # Known issues
  artifacts:         # Full implementation (was already there)
```

### 3. Files Created/Updated

#### New Methodology Docs:
- `Docs/EPIC-TIDE-ADV/EPIC_TIDE_METHODOLOGY_v3_AI_NATIVE.md` - Complete v3 spec
- `Docs/EPIC-TIDE-ADV/AI_NATIVE_PRINCIPLES.md` - Core principles
- `Docs/EPIC-TIDE-ADV/MIGRATION_TO_V3.md` - How to upgrade

#### New Templates:
- `TEMPLATES/PATH_v4_ai_native.yml` - Enriched PATH template
- `TEMPLATES/WORK_v4_ai_native.yml` - Enriched WORK template
- `TEMPLATES/TIDE_v4_ai_native.yml` - Execution with learning feedback

#### Example Implementations:
- `BLUEPRINTs/paths/kg4epic-mvp-enriched.yml` - Shows enriched PATH
- `BLUEPRINTs/works/setup-nodejs-project-v3-enriched.yml` - Shows enriched WORK

#### Minimal Bootstrap:
- `CLAUDE_v2.md` - Just 30 lines pointing to PATH

### 4. Critical Decisions Made

#### The Paradigm Shift:
**"Don't maintain separate context - embed it where it's used"**

#### Key Principles Established:
1. **Context Locality** - Context lives where needed
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Load only what's relevant  
3. **Learning Accumulation** - Every execution makes docs smarter
4. **Self-Containment** - Each doc has everything needed

### 5. Technical Specifications

#### For KG4EPIC Project:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Embeddings**: E5-large-v2 (1024 dimensions)
- **API**: POST-only endpoints for security
- **Docker**: Stack name 'gineers-kg4epic'
- **Approach**: LLM generates semantic, server generates system fields

#### Artifacts in WORKs:
We added `artifacts` section with actual code/schemas/configs so WORKs are executable, not just descriptive.

## The Philosophy We Established

> "In AI-native EPIC-TIDE, documents aren't just descriptions - they're executable knowledge units that carry their own context, learn from experience, and guide AI agents autonomously."

## Implementation Progress Update (2025-01-27 Late Session)

### What We Actually Did After Creating v3/v4:

#### 1. **Compliance Audit**
- Discovered only **2 out of 26 documents** were v4 compliant
- Created `BLUEPRINTs/COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md` showing the gap
- 92% of documents were still v1/v2 format

#### 2. **Migrated Critical WORKs to v4**
Created fully self-contained versions with all sections:
- `setup-docker-environment-v4.yml` ✅
- `design-database-schema-v4.yml` ✅  
- `implement-post-api-v4.yml` ✅

Each now includes:
- **context:** Environment, prerequisites, outputs
- **knowledge:** Critical technical information
- **learnings:** Experience from development
- **troubleshooting:** Known issues and solutions
- **artifacts:** Complete implementation code

#### 3. **Cleaned Up Version Sprawl**
- Archived all v1/v2 versions to `BLUEPRINTs/archive/`
- Kept only v3-enriched and v4 versions active
- Reduced confusion from multiple versions of same document

### The Key Realization:
Creating the methodology wasn't enough - we had to **actually migrate the documents** to realize the benefits.

## For Future Methodology Sessions

### To Continue Evolving EPIC-TIDE:

1. **Start Here**: Read this file to understand the journey
2. **Current Version**: v3 methodology, v4 templates (AI-Native)
3. **Latest Templates**: `TEMPLATES/*_v4_ai_native.yml`
4. **Core Doc**: `EPIC_TIDE_METHODOLOGY_v3_AI_NATIVE.md`
5. **Example v4 WORKs**: See `BLUEPRINTs/works/*-v4.yml` for reference

### Key Insights to Remember:

1. **Documents must be self-contained** - No external references
2. **Learning must flow back** - TIDEs update WORKs/PATHs
3. **Context loads progressively** - PATH → WORK → Artifacts
4. **Templates are critical** - They enforce consistency

### What Makes v3 Special:

```yaml
Traditional:
  Documentation → Read → Work → Forget

AI-Native v3:
  PATH (with context) → WORK (with everything) → Execute → Learn → Document improves
```

### Areas for Future Enhancement:

1. **Pattern Extraction** - Automated pattern discovery from TIDEs
2. **Learning Synthesis** - AI summarizing learnings across projects
3. **Version Control** - How WORKs evolve through versions
4. **Multi-Agent** - Multiple AI agents working from same PATHs

## Archive Note

We archived old versions to `Docs/EPIC-TIDE-ADV/archive/`:
- Old methodology versions (v1, v2)
- Old templates (v2, v3)
- Superseded examples

Keep archive for reference but use v4 templates for new work.

## The Achievement

We transformed EPIC-TIDE from a documentation methodology into an **AI-native execution system** where:
- Documents are living entities
- Context travels with work  
- Learning accumulates automatically
- AI agents work autonomously

This is not just an improvement - it's a **paradigm shift** in how AI agents interact with project documentation.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Theory vs Implementation Gap**
Creating v3/v4 templates was only 20% of the work. The real effort (80%) was migrating existing documents.

### 2. **Version Management is Critical**
We had v1, v2, v3-enriched, and v4 versions of same documents causing confusion. Archive aggressively.

### 3. **Self-Contained Really Means Everything**
v4 WORKs now include:
- Context (where to work)
- Knowledge (what to know)
- Learnings (what we discovered)
- Troubleshooting (what goes wrong)
- Artifacts (actual implementation)

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement Works**
Path: v1 (basic) → v2 (artifacts) → v3 (enriched) → v4 (fully self-contained)
Each version built on previous, didn't throw away work.

## Major Breakthrough: PHASE Concept (2025-01-28)

### The Discovery
Through KG4EPIC dogfooding, we identified a **critical gap** in EPIC-TIDE:
- **TIDEs** = Multiple attempts at SAME goal (horizontal iteration)
- **PHASEs** = Expanding scope/goals (vertical evolution)

### The Solution: EPIC-TIDE v5 Hierarchy
```yaml
PROGRAM (Overall Initiative)
└── PHASE (Scope boundary)
    └── PATH (Blueprint)
        └── TIDE (Execution attempt)
            └── PATTERN (Extracted knowledge)
```

### Phase vs TIDE Distinction
```yaml
TIDE: "API failed, try again with adaptations" (same goal)
PHASE: "API works, now add embeddings" (expanded goal)
```

### Tiered Embedding Strategy Decision
**Phase 1**: E5-large-v2 only (FREE - 1024 dims)
**Phase 2**: Add text-embedding-ada-002 for content (1536 dims)  
**Phase 3**: Add text-embedding-3-large for knowledge (3072 dims)

Each phase gets NEW PATHs with expanded scope, not just new TIDEs.

## Current State Summary (2025-01-28 Late Session)

### What's Ready:
- ✅ v3 AI-Native Methodology defined
- ✅ v4 Templates created
- ✅ ALL 16 WORKs migrated to v4
- ✅ Architecture reviewed and separated (KG4EPIC passive, ACC active)
- ✅ PHASE concept discovered and defined
- ✅ v5 Methodology with PHASE hierarchy created

### Critical Discovery (2025-01-28 Evening Session): Folder Structure Flaw
**Problem Identified**: Current folder structure violates v5 hierarchy
- PATHs and PHASEs are siblings instead of nested
- No mirroring structure in EXECUTIONs
- Database schema doesn't reflect hierarchy

**Solution**: v5.1 with corrected structure:
```
BLUEPRINTs/
  phases/
    PHASE_1_free.yml
    PHASE_1_free/
      paths/
        kg4epic-mvp.yml
  works/  # Shared pool (reusable across phases/paths)

EXECUTIONs/
  phases/
    PHASE_1_free/
      paths/
        kg4epic-mvp/
          TIDE_1/
```

**Key Insight**: WORKs are reusable components, not owned by specific PATHs

### Critical Principle Discovery (2025-01-28 Late): Evidence-Driven
**Fundamental Rule**: EPIC-TIDE is EVIDENCE-DRIVEN, not time-driven
- NO timelines, schedules, or deadlines
- Progress measured by evidence and events only
- Success determined by criteria, not calendars
- Iterations continue until evidence demonstrates success

### What's Next:
- ✅ v5.1 Methodology with corrected structure
- ✅ Evidence-driven principle enforced
- ✅ All time references removed from templates
- ✅ Database schema aligned with hierarchy

### The Core Innovation:
**"Self-contained documents that carry their own context and learn from experience"**

This enables AI agents to work autonomously without external lookups or centralized context files.
