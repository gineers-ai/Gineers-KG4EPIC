# EPIC-TIDE v8: Hybrid Human-AI Autonomy Architecture

**EPIC-TIDE**: Evidence-Powered Iterative Coordination through Transformative Intelligence-Driven Execution

## Executive Summary

**EPIC-TIDE v8 implements a hybrid architecture where humans and AI collaborate through clear handoff protocols. The system uses just three document types (BLUEPRINT, EXECUTION, PATTERN) with a CONFIRM gateway that establishes AI autonomy boundaries and TIDE/PHASE distinctions for unlimited attempts within approved goals.**

## Core Philosophy

> "Humans excel at envisioning the future (WHAT/WHY). AI excels at making it real (HOW)."

> "Humans set direction at PHASE boundaries, AI executes autonomously within TIDEs, Evidence drives all progress"

## The v8 Architecture

### Development Flow (Primary)
```
BLUEPRINT (YAML) → CONFIRM (Human) → TRANSLATOR (Auto) → EXECUTION (AI) → EVIDENCE (AI)
                      ↑                                                        ↓
                      └────────────── PHASE CHANGE (New Goal) ────────────────┘
```

### Knowledge Synthesis Flow (Secondary/Async)
```
EVIDENCE (AI) → PATTERN EXTRACTION (AI) → PATTERN LIBRARY
                                               ↓
                                    Future BLUEPRINTs benefit
```

**Key Insight**: Development and Knowledge Synthesis are SEPARATE processes.
- Development runs BLUEPRINT→EVIDENCE in a tight loop
- Pattern extraction happens asynchronously AFTER successful executions
- PHASE changes are triggered by EVIDENCE, not PATTERNS

## Key Innovations Over v6

### 1. The CONFIRM Gateway
- **Purpose**: Clear handoff point from human control to AI autonomy
- **Function**: Locks blueprint, validates constraints, initiates AI execution
- **Rule**: After CONFIRM, no human intervention until TIDE completes

### 2. TIDE vs PHASE Boundaries
- **TIDE**: AI autonomous execution within same goal (multiple attempts allowed)
- **PHASE**: Human confirmation required for goal changes
- **Flexibility**: AI can retry/adapt infinitely within TIDE

### 3. Hybrid Storage Strategy
- **BLUEPRINT**: YAML files for human authoring
- **EXECUTION**: Semantic database for AI consumption  
- **EVIDENCE**: Dual format (AI storage, human reports on demand)
- **PATTERNS**: AI-only format in database

### 4. Evidence-Only Progress
- **No Time**: Progress measured by evidence collected, not time elapsed
- **No Schedules**: Completion when criteria met, not deadline reached
- **Pure Merit**: Success when verification passed, not calendar kept

## Document Types and Storage

### BLUEPRINT (Human-Friendly YAML)
```yaml
BLUEPRINT:
  id: "auto_generated"
  scope: |
    [HUMAN WRITES]: Vision and goals
  
  # AI GENERATES:
  constraints: {...}
  works: {...}
  success_criteria: [...]
```
**Storage**: Git repository as YAML files
**Interface**: Text editors, version control

### EXECUTION (AI-Optimized)
```sql
-- Semantic document in database
{
  "semantic_summary": "AI-generated summary",
  "semantic_tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "work_atoms": [...],
  "embeddings": {...}
}
```
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with semantic fields
**Interface**: AI queries via embeddings

### EVIDENCE (Dual Format)
- **AI Format**: Structured records in database
- **Human Format**: Markdown reports generated on demand
**Storage**: Database with report generation API

### PATTERNS (AI-Only)
```sql
-- Pure machine learning format
{
  "problem_embedding": vector(1536),
  "solution_embedding": vector(1536),
  "applicability_score": 0.85
}
```
**Storage**: Database only
**Interface**: AI pattern matching

## The Execution Flow

### 1. BLUEPRINT Phase (Both)
- Human provides vision/goals
- AI embodies into concrete works
- Stored as YAML for review

### 2. CONFIRM Phase (Human Gateway)
- Human reviews AI's embodiment
- Validates constraints
- Provides credentials/resources
- **Locks blueprint** (no further changes)

### 3. TRANSLATOR Phase (Automatic)
- Converts YAML to semantic format
- Generates embeddings
- Creates work atoms
- Stores in AI-optimized database

### 4. EXECUTION Phase (AI Autonomous)
- AI executes works independently
- Can retry/adapt within TIDE
- No human intervention
- Evidence recorded automatically

### 5. EVIDENCE Phase (AI Records)
- Artifacts stored in database
- Verification automated
- Human reports generated on demand only
- Progress by evidence, not time

### 6. PATTERNS Phase (AI Learning)
- Patterns extracted from successful executions
- Stored in AI-only format
- Never shown to humans
- Used for future execution optimization

## Autonomy Boundaries

### Within TIDE (AI Autonomous)
✅ Retry failed works  
✅ Adapt approach  
✅ Reorder execution  
✅ Skip optional works  
✅ Add clarifying steps  
✅ Multiple attempts  

### Requires PHASE Change (Human Confirm)
❌ Change success criteria  
❌ Modify core constraints  
❌ Alter fundamental goal  
❌ Add major features  
❌ Change technology stack  

## Implementation Components

### 1. Confirmation Gateway
```python
class ConfirmationGateway:
    def confirm_blueprint(self, blueprint):
        # Human review and lock
        if human_confirms(blueprint):
            locked = lock_blueprint(blueprint)
            return initiate_ai_execution(locked)
        return request_adjustments()
```

### 2. Semantic Translator
```python
class SemanticTranslator:
    def translate(self, yaml_blueprint):
        # Automatic YAML to semantic conversion
        semantic = {
            'summary': ai_summarize(yaml_blueprint),
            'tags': extract_tags(yaml_blueprint),
            'embeddings': generate_embeddings(yaml_blueprint),
            'work_atoms': atomize_works(yaml_blueprint)
        }
        return store_semantic(semantic)
```

### 3. TIDE Executor
```python
class TIDEExecutor:
    def execute_tide(self, semantic_doc):
        # AI autonomous execution
        while not goal_met():
            result = execute_attempt()
            if can_adapt_within_goal():
                continue  # Stay in TIDE
            else:
                return request_phase_change()  # Need human
```

### 4. Report Generator
```python
class ReportGenerator:
    async def generate_on_demand(self, execution_id):
        # Human-readable reports (async, non-blocking)
        evidence = get_evidence(execution_id)
        return format_markdown_report(evidence)
```

## The v8 Principles

1. **Right Interface for Right Consumer** - YAML for humans, semantic for AI
2. **Clear Autonomy Boundaries** - TIDE vs PHASE distinction
3. **Evidence-Only Progress** - No time contamination
4. **Async Reporting** - Reports don't control execution
5. **AI Learning Isolation** - Patterns stay pure

## Future Vision: The Neural Network of Software Development

### The Ultimate Goal
EPIC-TIDE aims to create a system that functions like a real-world scale AI neural network for software development:

```
inputs(vision, constraints, tech stack) → hidden transformations(EPIC-TIDE ecosystem) → outputs(project, patternized knowledge)
```

### The Ecosystem Architecture (Future State)

```yaml
ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE:
  
  GINEERS_KG:
    role: "Document & Knowledge Storage"
    stores:
      - BLUEPRINTs (project/phase level)
      - EXECUTIONs (attempt records)
      - WORKs (proven execution patterns)
      - PATHs (successful execution sequences)
      - PATTERNs (extracted knowledge)
    purpose: "The long-term memory of the system"
      
  GINEERS_ACC:
    role: "AI Orchestration & Communication"
    functions:
      - Message queue between AI actors
      - Monitoring AI progress
      - Alerting on aberrations
      - Coordinating multi-actor execution
    purpose: "The nervous system connecting actors"
```

### Multi-Actor Vision (Not Yet Implemented)

```yaml
AI_ACTOR_TYPES:
  
  ARCHITECT:
    role: "System designer"
    creates: "BLUEPRINTs from human vision"
    
  DRIVER:
    role: "TIDE executor"
    creates: "EVIDENCE and code"
    
  QA:
    role: "Quality verifier"
    validates: "All evidence"
    
  COORDINATOR:
    role: "Multi-actor orchestrator"
    manages: "Inter-actor communication via ACC"
```

### The Incremental Path from v8

**Current (v8)**: Single AI actor with CONFIRM gateway
```
Human BLUEPRINT → CONFIRM → Single AI executes → EVIDENCE
```

**Next (v9)**: Knowledge extraction and reuse
```
EVIDENCE → WORK extraction → PATH formation → PATTERN library
```

**Future (v10+)**: Multi-actor orchestration
```
Multiple AI actors → ACC coordination → Parallel TIDEs → Unified project
```

### Why This Vision Matters

1. **Software as Neural Network**: Treats development as learned transformations, not prescribed steps
2. **True AI Autonomy**: AI as autonomous actors, not passive assistants
3. **Knowledge Compounds**: Every project makes future projects smarter
4. **Human-AI Symbiosis**: Humans envision (WHAT/WHY), AI implements (HOW)

### Critical Principles for the Journey

1. **Prove Before Scaling**: v8 must prove single-actor autonomy before multi-actor complexity
2. **Evidence Over Planning**: Let patterns emerge from success, don't pre-design them
3. **Incremental Evolution**: Each version must be production-ready, not a stepping stone
4. **Simplicity First**: Complexity only when evidence demands it

### The v8 Foundation

v8 provides the critical foundation for this vision:
- **CONFIRM gateway**: Establishes autonomy boundaries
- **TIDE/PHASE distinction**: Enables unlimited AI attempts
- **Evidence-first**: Creates the data for pattern extraction
- **Hybrid storage**: Supports both human and AI needs

The journey from v8 to the full vision will be evidence-driven, with each step validated by real-world success before proceeding to the next level of sophistication.

## System Interconnection Architecture

### Actor and System Definitions

```
U: User (Human stakeholder)
C: Claude Code (AI executor in terminal)
M: MCP Tool Server (Bridge between C and G)
G: Gineers-KG4EPIC (Knowledge storage)
A: Gineers-ACC (AI Control/Communication Center)
```

### Execution Flow: From Blueprint to Phase

```
U -> C : "Build a blog system"
C -> U : "What constraints, tech stack, and core features?"
C -> M : Retrieve relevant patterns
M -> G : Query API for similar projects
G -> M : Return patterns (0 or many)
C -> U : Propose BLUEPRINT based on patterns
U -> C : "CONFIRM" 
C      : Translate to AI-centric execution.yml
C      : Start autonomous TIDE execution
A      : Detect new execution (monitoring terminal)
C      : Emit structured status updates
A      : Parse terminal output, track progress
C      : Complete TIDE (success or failure)
A -> U : Alert completion status
U -> C : Approve success OR request new PHASE
```

### Terminal as Event Bus

The terminal becomes the primary communication channel through structured output:

```bash
[EPIC-TIDE:BLUEPRINT:READY:kg4epic-blog]
[EPIC-TIDE:CONFIRM:RECEIVED:2024-01-29T10:00:00Z]
[EPIC-TIDE:TIDE:1:START]
[EPIC-TIDE:WORK:database-setup:IN_PROGRESS]
[EPIC-TIDE:WORK:database-setup:COMPLETE]
[EPIC-TIDE:TIDE:1:FAILED:constraint-violation]
[EPIC-TIDE:TIDE:2:START]
[EPIC-TIDE:TIDE:2:SUCCESS]
[EPIC-TIDE:PHASE:CHANGE:NEEDED:goal-unachievable]
```

### ACC Orchestration Capabilities

1. **Terminal Monitoring**: ACC watches structured output
2. **Command Injection**: ACC can type commands to guide execution
3. **Multi-Actor Coordination**: ACC manages parallel terminal sessions
4. **Alert Management**: ACC notifies users of critical events

### State Machine

```
INITIAL
  ↓
BLUEPRINT_PROPOSED
  ↓
CONFIRM_RECEIVED ←─────┐
  ↓                    │
TIDE_EXECUTING         │
  ↓                    │
TIDE_COMPLETE ─────────┤
  ├─SUCCESS → END      │
  ├─RETRY → TIDE_EXECUTING
  └─PHASE_CHANGE ──────┘
```

### Critical Design Decisions

1. **No Direct IDs**: AI never generates system IDs (UUIDs handled by storage layer)
2. **Full Autonomy**: After CONFIRM, no human intervention until TIDE completes
3. **Structured Output**: All terminal communication uses parseable format
4. **Async Alerting**: ACC→User communication happens outside terminal

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Clean Separation**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Terminal Simplicity**: No complex APIs, just text parsing
- **AI Autonomy**: Claude Code executes without external dependencies
- **Orchestration Power**: ACC enables multi-actor coordination
- **Knowledge Reuse**: MCP bridge enables pattern-based development

The journey from v8 to the full vision will be evidence-driven, with each step validated by real-world success before proceeding to the next level of sophistication.

## Conclusion

v8 represents the optimal balance between:
- **Human usability** (keep YAML, clear confirmation)
- **AI performance** (semantic storage, embeddings)
- **Execution autonomy** (TIDE boundaries, no interference)
- **Practical deployment** (incremental, backward compatible)

The CONFIRM gateway and TIDE/PHASE boundaries create true AI autonomy while maintaining human oversight at appropriate decision points.
