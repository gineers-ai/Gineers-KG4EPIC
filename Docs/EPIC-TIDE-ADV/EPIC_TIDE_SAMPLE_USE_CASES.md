## Key Takeaways from Use Cases

1. **Simple Projects** (Flappy Bird): Single PATH, few WORKs, 1-2 TIDEs typical
2. **Standard Projects** (Memo Server): Single PATH, moderate WORKs, 2-3 TIDEs for perfection
3. **Complex Projects** (E-Commerce): Nested PATHs, many WORKs, 3+ TIDEs expected
4. **Parallel Projects** (Microservices): Heavy use of parallel execution
5. **Knowledge Evolution**: Patterns emerge after 3+ similar implementations

Each use case demonstrates:
- PATH orchestrates WORKs
- WORKs remain pure and reusable
- TIDEs show real execution with learning
- WHAT/HOW/METRIC structure scales from simple to complex
