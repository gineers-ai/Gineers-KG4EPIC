# === USAGE NOTES ===
# 1. Created automatically after BLUEPRINT CONFIRM
# 2. AI executes autonomously, updating this document
# 3. No human edits during execution
# 4. Multiple TIDEs (attempts) allowed for same goal
# 5. PHASE change request triggers human CONFIRM
# 6. Evidence stored in AI-optimized format
# 7. Human reports generated on demand only
