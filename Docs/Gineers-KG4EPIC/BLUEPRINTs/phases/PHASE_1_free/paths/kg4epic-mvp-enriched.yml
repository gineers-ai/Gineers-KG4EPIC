# PATH: KG4EPIC MVP (Enriched with Context)
# This PATH is the entry point for new Claude sessions

PATH:
  id: kg4epic-mvp
  what: "Build minimal KG4EPIC API to start using EPIC-TIDE"
  version: 1.0
  phase_id: phase_1_free
  
  # PROJECT CONTEXT (for new sessions)
  project:
    root: /Users/inseokseo/Gineers-Projects/Gineers-KG4EPIC
    type: "RESTful API with PostgreSQL + pgvector"
    status: "Ready for TIDE_1 execution"
    
  # CRITICAL DECISIONS
  decisions:
    security: "POST-only endpoints (no data in URLs)"
    database: "PostgreSQL with pgvector extension"
    embeddings: "E5-large-v2 (1024 dimensions)"
    docker_stack: "gineers-kg4epic"
    approach: "LLM generates semantic, server generates system fields"
  
  # EXECUTION SEQUENCE

  metrics:
    - "Docker stack running"
    - "Can save WORKs via POST"
    - "Can create PATHs via POST"
    - "Can start TIDEs via POST"
    - "Data persists in PostgreSQL"
  
  # LEARNINGS (accumulated from development)
  learnings:
    - "Artifacts in WORKs are essential for implementation"
    - "Start with file-based storage, migrate to PostgreSQL later is OK"
    - "E5-large-v2 requires 'query:' prefix for embeddings"

  # SESSION BOOTSTRAP
  for_new_session: |
    1. Read this PATH file first
    2. Check EXECUTIONs/tides/ for any existing TIDEs
    3. If no TIDE exists, start TIDE_1
    4. If TIDE exists, check its outcome and continue/adapt
    5. Use artifacts from v4 WORKs for implementation
    6. Reference PHASE_1_free.yml for strategic context and coordination
