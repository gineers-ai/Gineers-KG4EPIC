  # PROJECT CONTEXT (for TIDE_2)
  project:
    root: /Users/inseokseo/Gineers-Projects/Gineers-KG4EPIC
    type: "Validation and completion of TIDE_1 work"
    status: "Ready for TIDE_2 execution"
    
  # CRITICAL DECISIONS
  decisions:
    approach: "Fix gaps found in TIDE_1 review"
    priority: "Database schema first, then validation"
    testing: "Comprehensive integration tests"
    deployment: "Complete Docker orchestration"
    
  # TIDE_1 GAPS TO ADDRESS
  gaps_from_tide_1:
    database:
      - "Missing PHASES table"
      - "Missing PATH_WORKS junction table"

    api:
      - "Semantic search endpoints not implemented"
      - "Health check endpoint missing"
      - "Real embeddings service needed (no mocks)"
    testing:
      - "No tests created"
      - "No validation performed"
    docker:
      - "No unified docker-compose.yml"
      - "No health checks"
      - "Embeddings service container needed"

  # EVIDENCE REQUIRED
  evidence_required:
    - "Screenshot of all 6 tables in database"
    - "API test results showing all endpoints working"
    - "Coverage report showing 80%+ coverage"
    - "Docker ps showing all containers healthy"
    - "Successful E2E test execution log"
    
  # LEARNINGS FROM TIDE_1
  learnings_applied:
    - "Database schema must be deployed first"
    - "Validation should accompany implementation"
    - "Docker networking needs careful configuration"
    - "Testing should be built parallel to features"
    
  # COORDINATION
  coordination:
    with_tide_1: "Builds on completed work, doesn't duplicate"
    validation_first: "Each WORK validates before moving to next"
    no_new_features: "Focus only on completion and validation"
    
  # SESSION GUIDANCE
  for_new_session: |
    1. Check TIDE_1 execution results first
    2. Review gaps identified in TIDE_1 review
    3. Execute WORKs in sequence - database first
    4. Validate each WORK before proceeding
    5. Create detailed evidence of success
    6. Update TIDE_2 execution log continuously
    
  # NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESS
