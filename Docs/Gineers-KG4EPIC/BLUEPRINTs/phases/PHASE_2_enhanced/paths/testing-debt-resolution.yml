    tools: |
      - Jest for Node.js testing
      - pytest for Python embeddings service
      - Supertest for API testing
      - Docker-compose for test environment

  # TECHNICAL DEBT FROM PHASE_1
  debt_to_address:
    high_priority:
      - "Zero test coverage currently"
      - "No validation of API contracts"
      - "Manual testing only"
      
    medium_priority:
      - "No performance benchmarks"
      - "No load testing"
      - "No security tests"
      
  # RISK MITIGATION
  risks:
    breaking_changes:
      risk: "Tests reveal broken functionality"
      mitigation: "Fix issues as discovered"
      benefit: "Better system reliability"
      
    time_investment:
      risk: "Testing takes significant time"
      mitigation: "Prioritize critical paths"
      value: "Prevents future regressions"
      
  # LEARNINGS FROM PHASE_1
  applied_learnings:
    - "Tests should be created with features"
    - "Docker environment needs test mode"
    - "Mock external services appropriately"
    - "Evidence-driven testing approach"
    
  # COORDINATION
  coordination:
    parallel_work: "Can run alongside other PHASE_2 paths"
    no_dependencies: "Independent of embedding enhancements"
    enables: "Confident future development"
    
  # SESSION GUIDANCE
  for_new_session: |
    1. Review current code structure
    2. Set up Jest and pytest frameworks
    3. Start with API integration tests
    4. Add unit tests for critical functions
    5. Create E2E test for EPIC-TIDE flow
    6. Set up coverage reporting
    7. Document test procedures
    
  # TESTING BEST PRACTICES
  best_practices:
    - "Test behavior, not implementation"
    - "Each test should be independent"
    - "Use descriptive test names"
    - "Mock external dependencies"
    - "Test edge cases and errors"
    - "Keep tests fast and focused"
