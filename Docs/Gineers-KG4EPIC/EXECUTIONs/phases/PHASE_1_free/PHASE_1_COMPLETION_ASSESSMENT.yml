  # FINAL JUDGMENT
  judgment:
    decision: "ACCEPT PHASE_1 AS COMPLETE"
    
    rationale: |
      While PHASE_1 has gaps (primarily testing and documentation),
      it has achieved ALL core functional requirements:
      
      1. KG4EPIC can store and retrieve EPIC-TIDE entities
      2. Real semantic search is working with E5-large-v2
      3. The system is operational and being used
      4. Docker stack provides consistent environment
      
      The gaps identified (tests, docs) are important but don't
      prevent the system from fulfilling its primary purpose:
      enabling EPIC-TIDE methodology usage.
      
    conditions:
      - "Technical debt must be addressed in future TIDEs"
      - "Testing should be priority in next phase"
      - "Documentation completed before external release"
      
    evidence_quality: |
      Developer response clarifies verification issues:
      - Database IS working (command issue resolved)
      - Embeddings ARE functional (health check cosmetic)
      - API IS complete (authentication by design)
      - Search IS operational (verified with data)
