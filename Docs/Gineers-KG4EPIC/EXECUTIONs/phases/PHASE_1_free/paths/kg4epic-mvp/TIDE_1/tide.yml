# TIDE_1: First attempt to execute kg4epic-mvp PATH under PHASE_1_free

TIDE:
  attempt: 1
  path_ref: kg4epic-mvp
  phase_ref: PHASE_1_free
  started: "2025-01-28T10:00:00Z"
  
  # Project context for this TIDE
  context:
    project_root: /Users/inseokseo/Gineers-Projects/Gineers-KG4EPIC
    goal: "Build minimal KG4EPIC API server with PostgreSQL + pgvector"
    approach: "Using v5.1 methodology with shared WORKs pool"
    architecture: "PASSIVE STORAGE ONLY - no pattern extraction"
    
  # Critical decisions made
  decisions:
    security: "POST-only endpoints"
    database: "PostgreSQL with pgvector v5.1 schema"
    embeddings: "E5-large-v2 (1024 dimensions)"
    docker_stack: "gineers-kg4epic"

  # Will be updated as we progress
  outcome: success
  
  # Learnings will be captured here
  learnings: |
    - v5.1 structure requires proper PHASE→PATH→TIDE hierarchy
    - WORKs are shared resources in BLUEPRINTs/works/
    - Database schema needs PHASES table and PATH_WORKS junction
    - KG4EPIC must remain passive storage only
    - dotenv.config() must be called BEFORE importing database module
    - pgvector requires array format [n,n,n] not JSON for vectors
    - E5-large-v2 model loads on first use (takes ~30s)
    - Docker password must match between .env and docker-compose
    
  # Issues encountered and resolutions
  troubleshooting: |
    - Initial TIDE was in wrong location (tides/ instead of phases/PHASE_1_free/paths/kg4epic-mvp/TIDE_1/)
    - Database schema needs v5.1 update for PHASES and junction tables
