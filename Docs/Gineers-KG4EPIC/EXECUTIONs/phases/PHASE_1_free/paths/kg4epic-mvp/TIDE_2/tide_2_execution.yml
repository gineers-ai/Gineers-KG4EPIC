TIDE:
  number: 2
  path_id: kg4epic-validation
  started_at: "2025-01-28T19:00:00+09:00"
  completed_at: "2025-01-28T20:00:00+09:00"
  outcome: "PARTIAL_SUCCESS"
  
  # CONTEXT - What we started with
  context:
    tide_1_status: |
      - Database: Partial schema (missing PHASES, PATH_WORKS tables)
      - API: Working but using mock embeddings
      - Docker: 2 containers (postgres, api)
      - Tests: None created
      - Semantic search: Not implemented
    
    critical_gaps:
      - "No real embeddings (ESM module issues in Docker)"
      - "Database schema incomplete (4/6 tables)"
      - "No semantic search endpoints"
      - "Zero test coverage"
      - "No health checks"
  
  # DECISIONS - Key architectural choices made
  decisions:
    embeddings_strategy: |
      Created separate Python embeddings service instead of using Node.js
      - Reason: ONNX runtime issues in Node Alpine container
      - Solution: FastAPI service with sentence-transformers
      - Model: intfloat/e5-large-v2 (1024 dimensions)
    
    database_approach: |
      Complete schema rebuild rather than incremental migration
      - Dropped all tables and recreated with v5.1 spec
      - Added all 6 required tables with proper relationships
      - UUID primary keys throughout
    
    docker_architecture: |
      3-container stack with health checks
      - kg4epic-postgres: PostgreSQL with pgvector
      - kg4epic-embeddings: Python FastAPI for E5-large
      - kg4epic-api: Node.js Express API
