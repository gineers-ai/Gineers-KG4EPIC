  # COMPLIANCE SCORE
  compliance:
    epic_tide_structure: "100%"  # Files now in correct location
    evidence_driven: "80%"        # Good evidence but some unverified
    work_completion: "62.5%"      # 2.5 of 4 WORKs completed
    verification_possible: "40%"  # Many claims cannot be verified
    
  # FINAL ASSESSMENT
  assessment:
    strengths:
      - "Proper EPIC-TIDE execution structure followed"
      - "Good problem-solving (Python embeddings service)"
      - "Comprehensive learnings captured"
      - "Evidence artifacts referenced"
      
    weaknesses:
      - "Core functionality cannot be verified"
      - "Embeddings service unhealthy"
      - "No tests created"
      - "Database state unknown"
      
    conclusion: |
      TIDE_2 shows good progress on completing TIDE_1 gaps, particularly
      in creating a real embeddings service and updating the database schema.
      However, the inability to verify the actual state of the system
      (database tables, API functionality, search accuracy) means we cannot
      confirm the claimed SUCCESS status. The embeddings service health issue
      and API authentication requirements prevent full validation.
      
      Recommend TIDE_3 focus on:
      1. Fixing health checks
      2. Creating verifiable tests
      3. Providing runnable evidence
      4. Documenting the working system
