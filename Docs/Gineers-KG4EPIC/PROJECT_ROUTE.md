```

## PROJECT Vision

```yaml
mission: |
  Build a knowledge system that captures HOW TO BUILD WHAT,
  sequences knowledge into achievable paths,
  and preserves learning from every attempt.

core_principles:
  - "Every action is a CONTRACT"
  - "Every goal is a ROUTE"
  - "Every attempt is a TIDE with learning"
  - "Evidence drives progress, not time"
```

## Risk Management

```yaml
strategic_risks:
  - risk: "EPIC-TIDE concept too complex"
    mitigation: "Start with minimal PoC_1"
    evidence: "User can explain CONTRACT vs ROUTE vs TIDE"
    
  - risk: "Performance at scale"
    mitigation: "Two-tier embedding strategy"
    evidence: "Cost reduced by 99.5%"
    
  - risk: "Adoption resistance"
    mitigation: "Clear value demonstration in PoC_1"
    evidence: "Learning preservation saves time"
```

## Technology Stack

```yaml
core:
  - "PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector"
  - "Node.js 18 + TypeScript"
  - "Docker + Docker Compose"
  - "Express.js REST API"

future:
  - "E5-large-v2 embeddings"
  - "Redis caching"
  - "Kubernetes orchestration"
  - "Grafana monitoring"
```
