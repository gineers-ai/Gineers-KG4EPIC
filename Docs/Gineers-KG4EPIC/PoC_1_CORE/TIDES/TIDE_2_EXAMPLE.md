# TIDE_2: Hypothetical Second Attempt

## TIDE Metadata

```yaml
tide_id: "TIDE_POC1_001_2"
route_id: "ROUTE_GINEERS_KG_POC1_001"
route_name: "EPIC-TIDE Core for Gineers-KG4EPIC"
tide_number: 2
tide_type: "executed"
created_by: "Terminal-1-architect"
created_at: "2025-01-26"
status: "success"
```

## Learning from TIDE_1

```yaml
tide_1_failures:
  CONTRACT_003_API_STRUCTURE:
    issue: "TypeScript path aliases not working"
    learning: "Need to configure tsconfig paths and ts-node"
    
  CONTRACT_006_TIDE_EXECUTION:
    issue: "JSONB update mutations failing"
    learning: "PostgreSQL JSONB needs proper operators"
```

## CONTRACT Execution Results

### CONTRACT_001_DOCKER_SETUP
```yaml
status: "reused"
evidence: "Containers still running from TIDE_1"
execution_time: "0s"
notes: "No need to recreate"
```

### CONTRACT_002_DATABASE_SCHEMA
```yaml
status: "reused"
evidence: "Tables already exist from TIDE_1"
execution_time: "0s"
notes: "Schema stable"
```

### CONTRACT_003_API_STRUCTURE
```yaml
status: "completed"
evidence:
  - "Fixed tsconfig.json paths configuration"
  - "Added ts-node path mapping"
  - "Server running successfully"
execution_time: "5m"
fix_applied: |
  Added to tsconfig.json:
  "paths": {
    "@core/*": ["src/core/*"],
    "@api/*": ["src/api/*"]
  }
```

### CONTRACT_004_CONTRACT_CRUD
```yaml
status: "reused"
evidence: "CRUD working from TIDE_1"
execution_time: "0s"
```

### CONTRACT_005_ROUTE_CRUD
```yaml
status: "reused"
evidence: "ROUTE operations verified"
execution_time: "0s"
```

### CONTRACT_006_TIDE_EXECUTION
```yaml
status: "completed"
evidence:
  - "Fixed JSONB update syntax"
  - "Used jsonb_set function correctly"
  - "TIDE tracking fully functional"
execution_time: "15m"
fix_applied: |
  Changed from: UPDATE SET contracts_executed = $1
  To: UPDATE SET contracts_executed = jsonb_set(contracts_executed, '{path}', $1)
```

### CONTRACT_007_TEST_EXECUTION
```yaml
status: "completed"
evidence:
  - "Test ROUTE created"
  - "Simulated failure and recovery"
  - "Learning preservation verified"
execution_time: "10m"
```

### CONTRACT_008_LEARNING_EXTRACTION
```yaml
status: "completed"
evidence:
  - "Learning report generated"
  - "Patterns identified"
  - "PoC completion validated"
execution_time: "5m"
```

## Overall Outcome

```yaml
outcome: "success"
total_contracts: 8
contracts_completed: 8
contracts_reused: 4
contracts_fixed: 2
total_execution_time: "35m"
```

## Learnings Captured

```yaml
technical_learnings:
  - "TypeScript path mapping requires both tsconfig and ts-node configuration"
  - "PostgreSQL JSONB updates need specific operators"
  - "Reusing successful CONTRACTs saves significant time"
  
process_learnings:
  - "First TIDE typically has 20-30% failure rate"
  - "Configuration issues are most common in TIDE_1"
  - "Clear error messages essential for quick fixes"
  
patterns_identified:
  - pattern: "Configuration Issues"
    frequency: "High in TIDE_1"
    solution: "Create configuration validation CONTRACT"
    
  - pattern: "Database Operations"
    frequency: "Medium complexity"
    solution: "Use ORM or query builder for complex operations"
```

## Proof of Success

```yaml
evidence_collected:
  database:
    screenshot: "three_tables_created.png"
    query_results: "all_tables_populated.sql"
    
  apis:
    postman_collection: "epic_tide_apis.json"
    test_results: "all_endpoints_passing.txt"
    
  execution:
    tide_history: "2 TIDEs showing improvement"
    learning_report: "patterns_extracted.md"
    
  poc_completion:
    all_contracts: "8/8 completed"
    route_status: "PROVEN"
    ready_for: "PoC_2_SEMANTIC_SEARCH"
```

## Next Steps

```yaml
immediate:
  - "Mark ROUTE as proven"
  - "Update PROJECT_ROUTE.md status"
  - "Extract reusable patterns"
  
next_poc:
  - "Begin PoC_2_SEMANTIC_SEARCH"
  - "Reuse CONTRACT_001, CONTRACT_002, CONTRACT_003"
  - "Add new CONTRACTs for embeddings"
```
