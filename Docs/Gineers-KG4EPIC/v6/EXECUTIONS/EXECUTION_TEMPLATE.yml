  # CONSTRAINT VALIDATION - Proving we followed constraints
  constraints_validated:
    embeddings:
      ada002: "✓ Service running on port 8001"
      e5: "✓ Existing service on port 8000"
    testing:
      framework: "✓ Jest configured"
      coverage: "✗ Currently 45%"
  
  # SUCCESS CRITERIA RESULTS - Evidence of success
  criteria_results:
    functional:
      - "✓ Ada-002 operational"
      - "✗ Pattern extraction not started"
      - "✗ Tests at 45% coverage"
    performance:
      - "✓ Search latency 150ms"
      - "- Pattern extraction not measured"
  
  # LEARNINGS - What we discovered
  learnings:
    technical:
      - "OpenAI API has 3 req/sec rate limit on free tier"
      - "Ada-002 requires different vector column (1536 dims)"
    architectural:
      - "Separate services allow independent scaling"
    process:
      - "Test OpenAI connectivity before Docker setup"

  # NEXT STEPS
  next_execution:
    focus: "Complete pattern extraction"
