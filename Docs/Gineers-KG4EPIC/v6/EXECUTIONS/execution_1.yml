  # LEARNINGS
  learnings:
    technical:
      - "OpenAI API key already configured as OPENAI_API_KEY_ADA_002"
      - "Current stack uses 3 containers (postgres, embeddings, api)"
      - "E5-large-v2 working well with 1024 dimensions"
      
    architectural:
      - "Python services proven reliable for embeddings"
      - "Separate services allow language optimization"
      
    process:
      - "PHASE_1 created solid foundation to build on"
      - "Evidence-driven approach validates progress"
