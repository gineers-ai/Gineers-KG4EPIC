  slug: "epic-tide-v8-phase-1-t2"  # t2 = Terminal 2 execution
  name: "EPIC-TIDE v8 Foundation - Fresh Start"
  
  # === PHASE MANAGEMENT ===

    number: 1  # Fresh Phase 1 with v8
    previous_phase_slug: null  # Fresh start, no previous
    goal_change: false  # New beginning, not a change
  
  # === HUMAN SECTION (Vision & Goals) ===
  vision: |
    Create a clean, PASSIVE document storage system for EPIC-TIDE v8.
    KG4EPIC is purely infrastructure - it stores blueprints, executions, and patterns
    that are created by EXTERNAL systems (Claude, humans, etc).
    
    KG4EPIC does NOT execute anything. It does NOT manage workflows. It does NOT
    implement CONFIRM gates. It is a sophisticated filing cabinet with semantic search,
    responding to MCP tool requests to store and retrieve documents.
    
    Key focus: PASSIVE storage, fast retrieval, MCP compatibility.
  
  goals:
    - "Deploy v8 database schema as PASSIVE storage (blueprints, executions, patterns tables)"
    - "Create /api/tool endpoint for MCP server integration"
    - "Implement CRUD operations for all v8 document types"
    - "Enable semantic search using existing embedding services (E5 and ada-002)"
    - "Store documents when Claude/MCP requests storage"
    - "Retrieve documents when Claude/MCP requests retrieval"
    - "NO execution logic - KG4EPIC only stores what others execute"

  scope: |
    Technical implementation of EPIC-TIDE v8 storage and execution system.
    Focus on core v8 tables, CONFIRM mechanism, and autonomous execution engine.

  # === FOR AI AFTER CONFIRM ===
  for_ai: |
    After human CONFIRMS this blueprint:
    1. This becomes immutable - no changes allowed
    2. You have full autonomy within TIDEs
    3. You can retry/adapt within same goal
    4. Collect evidence for all verifications
    5. Report evidence in dual format
    6. If goal change needed, request new PHASE
    
    Remember: This is a FRESH START. Do not reference or migrate
    anything from the old v5.1 structure. Build clean v8 from scratch.
    
  # === HUMAN NOTES ===
  human_notes: |
    - This is Terminal 2 (t2) execution - developer perspective
    - Fresh start approved after v8 alignment assessment
    - Keep Docker infrastructure and embedding services
    - Everything else is fresh implementation
    - Focus on simplicity and correctness over features
    - True dogfooding of v8 principles is the goal
    - MCP integration is CRITICAL for Claude Desktop usage
    - Single /api/tool endpoint must handle all MCP operations
    - Response format must strictly follow MCP contract

# === CONFIRMATION GATE ===
# After human reviews and confirms this blueprint:
# - It becomes locked (immutable)
# - AI gets full autonomy for execution
# - Multiple TIDE attempts allowed
# - No human intervention until phase complete
