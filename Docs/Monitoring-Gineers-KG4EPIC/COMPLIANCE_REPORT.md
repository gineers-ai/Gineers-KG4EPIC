# EPIC-TIDE v4 Template Compliance Report

## Summary
Only **2 out of 26 documents** follow the new v4 AI-native template.

## Compliant Documents (v4 AI-Native) ✅

### PATHs:
- `paths/kg4epic-mvp-enriched.yml` - Fully enriched with project, decisions, learnings, for_new_session

### WORKs:
- `works/setup-nodejs-project-v3-enriched.yml` - Fully enriched with context, knowledge, learnings, troubleshooting

## Non-Compliant Documents (Need Update) ❌

### PATHs Missing v4 Sections:
1. `gineers-kg4epic-foundation.yml` - Missing: project, decisions, learnings, for_new_session
2. `gineers-kg4epic-mvp.yml` - Missing: all enrichment sections
3. `kg4epic-api-server.yml` - Missing: all enrichment sections
4. `kg4epic-mvp.yml` - Missing: all enrichment sections (duplicate of enriched version exists)

### WORKs Missing v4 Sections:
All WORKs except `setup-nodejs-project-v3-enriched.yml` are missing:
- `context:` section (location, prerequisites, outputs)
- `knowledge:` section (critical information)
- `learnings:` section (from executions)
- `troubleshooting:` section (known issues)

## Version Confusion

### Multiple Versions of Same Document:
- `setup-nodejs-project.yml` (v1)
- `setup-nodejs-project-v2.yml` (has artifacts)
- `setup-nodejs-project-v3-enriched.yml` (v4 compliant) ✅

- `design-database-schema.yml` (v1)
- `design-database-schema-v2.yml` (has artifacts)

- `setup-docker-environment.yml` (v1)
- `setup-docker-environment-v2.yml` (has artifacts)

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions:
- Archive all non-v2/v3 versions to reduce confusion
- Update critical WORKs for MVP to v4 template:
  - `setup-docker-environment-v2.yml` → Add context, learnings sections
  - `design-database-schema-v2.yml` → Add context, troubleshooting
  - `implement-post-api-v2.yml` → Add context, knowledge, learnings

### 2. PATH Consolidation:
- Keep only `kg4epic-mvp-enriched.yml` as the primary PATH
- Archive other MVP variations

### 3. Template Compliance Priority:
Focus on documents with artifacts (-v2) and upgrade them to v4:
1. Has artifacts but needs enrichment → Priority 1
2. No artifacts, no enrichment → Priority 2 (or archive)

## Critical WORKs for MVP (Need v4 Update):

| WORK | Has Artifacts | Has Enrichment | Action Needed |
|------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| setup-nodejs-project-v3-enriched | ✅ | ✅ | None - Compliant |
| setup-docker-environment-v2 | ✅ | ❌ | Add enrichment sections |
| design-database-schema-v2 | ✅ | ❌ | Add enrichment sections |
| implement-post-api-v2 | ✅ | ❌ | Add enrichment sections |

## Conclusion

The project has good foundation with artifacts in -v2 files, but needs enrichment to be v4 AI-native compliant. Only 8% of documents follow the new template, indicating significant migration work needed.
