# 🚀 FRESH START: KG4EPIC v8 Implementation Plan

## Executive Decision
**YES - FRESH START with EPIC-TIDE v8!** 

Clean slate with v8 architecture while preserving working infrastructure.

---

## What We Keep (Working Infrastructure) ✅

### 1. Docker Infrastructure
```yaml
kg4epic-postgres: PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector ✓
kg4epic-embeddings: E5-large-v2 on port 8000 ✓  
kg4epic-embeddings-ada002: OpenAI ada-002 on port 8001 ✓
kg4epic-api: Node.js API (needs refactor but container works) ✓
```

### 2. Embedding Services
- **E5 Service**: Python FastAPI, 1024 dims, working perfectly
- **Ada-002 Service**: Python FastAPI, 1536 dims, rate-limited, operational
- **Both tested and proven in production**

### 3. Core Learnings from Journey
- Python microservices for embeddings (Node.js ONNX issues)
- POST-only APIs for security
- Health checks critical for multi-container
- Evidence-driven validation prevents false completion
- Semantic search needs proper prefixes (query:/passage:)

## What We Build Fresh (v8 Architecture) 🆕

### 1. New Database Schema (v8)
```sql
-- Drop ALL old tables
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;

-- Create v8 tables
CREATE TABLE blueprints (...);          -- Human YAML storage
CREATE TABLE semantic_executions (...); -- AI-optimized
CREATE TABLE confirmation_records (...); -- Audit trail
CREATE TABLE evidence_records (...);     -- Dual format
CREATE TABLE patterns_library (...);     -- AI patterns
```

### 2. New Document Model (Simplified)
```
OLD (v5.1): PHASE → PATH → WORK → TIDE → PATTERN (5 types)
NEW (v8):   BLUEPRINT → EXECUTION → PATTERN (3 types)
```

### 3. New API Structure
```
/api/v8/blueprint/create     -- Human creates vision
/api/v8/blueprint/translate  -- AI generates works
/api/v8/confirm/lock         -- Human confirms, locks blueprint
/api/v8/execution/start      -- AI begins autonomous execution
/api/v8/execution/status     -- Check progress
/api/v8/evidence/collect     -- AI reports evidence
/api/v8/pattern/extract      -- Async pattern mining
```

### 4. CONFIRM Gateway (New Core Feature)
- Locks blueprint after human approval
- No changes after CONFIRM
- AI gets full autonomy within TIDE
- Clear handoff protocol

## Implementation Phases (Evidence-Driven)

### PHASE 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: v8 database and basic API

**BLUEPRINT_1**: kg4epic-v8-foundation
```yaml
vision: |
  Deploy EPIC-TIDE v8 schema with basic CRUD operations
  Get CONFIRM gateway working with blueprint locking
  
success_criteria:
  - v8 database schema deployed
  - Blueprint CRUD working
  - CONFIRM lock mechanism functional
  - Basic semantic translation
```

### PHASE 2: AI Autonomy (Week 2)
**Goal**: Autonomous execution within TIDEs

**BLUEPRINT_2**: kg4epic-v8-autonomy
```yaml
vision: |
  Implement autonomous AI execution engine
  Multiple TIDE attempts without human intervention
  Evidence collection and reporting
  
success_criteria:
  - AI executes works autonomously
  - TIDE retry logic working
  - Evidence properly collected
  - No human intervention needed
```

### PHASE 3: Intelligence Layer (Week 3)
**Goal**: Pattern extraction and learning

**BLUEPRINT_3**: kg4epic-v8-intelligence
```yaml
vision: |
  Extract patterns from successful executions
  Build pattern library for future use
  Implement pattern-guided execution
  
success_criteria:
  - Patterns extracted from evidence
  - Pattern library searchable
  - Future blueprints benefit from patterns
```

---

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Create New Database
```bash
# Create fresh v8 database
docker exec kg4epic-postgres psql -U epic_user -c "CREATE DATABASE epic_tide_v8;"

# Deploy v8 schema
docker exec kg4epic-postgres psql -U epic_user -d epic_tide_v8 < database/v8-schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Preserve Embeddings Services
```bash
# Keep existing services running
# Just point API to new database
# No changes needed to embedding containers
```

### Step 3: Build New API Layer
```bash
# Fresh Node.js API with v8 endpoints
# Reuse embedding service clients
# Implement CONFIRM gateway
```

---

## First BLUEPRINT (Start Here)

```yaml
# blueprints/kg4epic-v8-foundation.yml
BLUEPRINT:
  slug: "kg4epic-v8-foundation"
  name: "KG4EPIC v8 Foundation"
  
  vision: |
    Create a clean v8 implementation of KG4EPIC that properly
    demonstrates EPIC-TIDE v8 principles. Focus on the CONFIRM
    gateway and autonomous AI execution within TIDEs.
    
  goals:
    - Deploy v8 database schema
    - Implement CONFIRM gateway
    - Create blueprint management API
    - Enable AI autonomous execution
    
  # AI will generate the rest after CONFIRM
```

## Why Fresh Start is Better

### 1. Cleaner Architecture
- 3 documents vs 5+ documents
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better human-AI boundaries

### 2. Simpler Implementation
- Less code overall
- Fewer API endpoints
- Clearer execution flow

### 3. True v8 Dogfooding
- Demonstrates v8 principles
- Shows CONFIRM gateway
- Proves AI autonomy

### 4. Faster Development
- No legacy baggage
- No migration complexity
- Start with best practices

---

## Decision Required

### Option A: Fresh Start (RECOMMENDED) ✅
- **Time**: 2-3 weeks to v8 MVP
- **Risk**: Low (keeping working parts)
- **Benefit**: Clean, correct implementation

### Option B: Refactor Existing ❌
- **Time**: 4-6 weeks (more complex)
- **Risk**: High (mixing old and new)
- **Benefit**: Preserves some work (but most is wrong anyway)

---

## Next Actions (If Approved)

1. **Create new repo/folder** for v8 implementation
2. **Deploy v8 database schema** fresh
3. **Copy Docker setup** (keep embeddings services)
4. **Create first BLUEPRINT** in YAML
5. **Implement CONFIRM gateway** 
6. **Build execution engine**
7. **Start first autonomous TIDE**

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Fresh start with v8. It's simpler, cleaner, and will be faster than refactoring.**

The old code served its purpose - we learned what works. Now we build it right with v8.
